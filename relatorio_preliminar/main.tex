\section{Introduction}

Here you should motivate your work. 

What is the context? \\

What is the problem? \\

Why is it important? \\

What data and methods are you thinking about using to tackle it? \\

How is your approach different from what was already done (if something was done). \\

How is this document organised? \\

\section{Background} \label{sec:background}

This section should contain any information needed to understand the problem you are tackling.

\subsection{You choose the sections} 



\subsection{Add as many as you need} 


\section{Related Work} \label{sec:relatedwork}

This is the time to do a literature review! \\

What is the state of the art on the topic you are working? \\

Previous work with same data, similar work with other data, ... \\

Problems tackled, data science approaches used, pros and cons, ... \\ 


Example of a reference\cite{lamport1994}. This was a book, but all other relevant works in papers \cite{turing1937} could be added as well.

\section{Data \{if necessary\} } \label{sec:data}

Here you should describe your data in as much detail as possible. \\ 

You can describe raw data and any pre-processing need for your work. \\

You can have a section on exploratory data analysis. \\

\section{Methods} \label{sec:methods}

Here you should describe in as much details as possible the problem and your plan to tackle it. \\

What are the methods you are planning to use, or already started to use, to tackle your problem. \\

This should be based on related word, your understanding of the problem and eventually preliminary exploratory data analysis or preliminary results.

\subsection{You decide on the subsection} 

\section{Preliminary Results (Optional)} \label{sec:preliminaryresults}

Here you can include preliminary results if you already have them.


\section{Forthcoming Work} \label{sec:forthcomingwork}

Here you should write the conclusion of the preliminary work and the goals for the remaining period.
